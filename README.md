# ProBro - The Project Browser

Project Browser application with some features for project management, built upon a simple Java file browser implemented in Swing. 

This application basically is a file browser, featuring a file system tree and a folder content table, as well as a details panel for a selected file/folder. It additionally allows to load deep info of the selected folder, which enables the user to have all folder sizes determined recurively, which is very useful when cleaning up your hard disk for example.

For project administration of projects of any kind, there are some extra features:

In the projects view (see View menu), when the user selects a folder and clicks the button "select project info", the program scans the currently selected folder recursively and tries to find a specific pattern of folders/files which are defined as project structures in the ProBro XML configuration file.

You can define the project structure you typically use (see class ProjectDefinition for details). The use case for me (and the reason this application has been developed) was to scan for DAW music projects made with ProTools and Logic Pro. I always have at least one of the folders named _MA (Masters), _MIX (Mixes), etc. in my audio projects, so these are defined as qualifiers for folders being project folders. Also, the audio files (defined by file extensions) and session files (dito) are defined in XML, as well as different colors for different file types etc., which can be used to show the existence of compressed audio files for example. The given default XML configuration is my personal one, however, you can easily define your own project structure habits also for completely different projects, too. The concept is as generic as possible.

# Features

- Basic file browsing
- Loading / visualizing the real size of any files/folders in the system
- Project overview of selected folder, generated by a XML definition of project structure and the files on the system (no temporary data is stored anywhere)
- Compressing selected items with the command line ZIP tool (not available in Windows yet), this can be done for multiple folders in parallel, also showing the progress in a task bar on the right side, which also can terminate the ZIP processes on double click
- Determination of the Year of the project, by either extracting this from the project folder name, or by the earliest existing file in on of the project default folders (a.k.a. project targets)
- Project leftovers view, showing all folders which have NOT been detected (qualified) as projects and which are not part of a project themselves 

# Bugs / Requested Features

See the GITHUB issue tracking list.

# Compatibility

This is built upon Java 1.8 and the following binary bundles are provided:
1. For Mac OS X, an app bundle can be downloaded and directly be put into your Applications folder. The bundle contains its own JRE, so nothing has to be installed.
2. For all other platforms, the .jar file can be used. Sorry, no .exe has been created...if you like to contribute this, let me know. However, the application has been tested on Windows and works flawlessly, except for the ZIP functionality which is only available on Unix-like systems.


# Release Note

The application currently is in alpha state, and not usable yet. When the project is in beta testing (with myself as the main beta tester), i will note that again in this README file.
